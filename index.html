      Fasting, the reduction or complete removal of calories in one’s diet for a
      set period of time, improves the metabolic health of mice. In 2017,
      researchers wanted to test if a fasting-like diet in humans could improve
      their health as well. They constructed a diet, called the fasting-mimicking
      diet (FMD), that consisted of five days of reduced caloric intake followed
      by twenty five days of normal eating. The researchers recorded data on the
      health of people following the FMD and compared those results with people
      who ate a normal, non-fasting diet over a three month period.
      <br />
      <br />
      Three important results are found in the study’s data. First, the FMD was a
      safe diet for the participants. While many fasting diets can be unhealthy or
      outright dangerous, the FMD only caused mild to moderate symptoms and no
      harmful effects were measured in liver, kidney or metabolic function. Thus,
      the FMD is a safe option for those looking to implement a form of fasting
      into their diet.
      <br />
      <br />
      Secondly, the FMD was quite beneficial to the health of those who followed
      the diet. On average, those on the FMD lost 5.7 pounds compared to no weight
      reduction in those who were on a normal diet. The waist circumference and
      blood pressure on those on the FMD was also reduced, along with levels of
      IGF-1, a hormone associated with an increased risk of disease and death,
      compared to the participants not on the FMD.
      <br />
      <br />
      To ensure the validity of these results, the researchers then had the
      participants who were not on the FMD switch over to the FMD for three
      months. Similar data was recorded after this group was on the FMD, again
      showing a reduction in weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and
      IGF-1. Therefore, the study shows that the FMD has strong potential to
      improve human health despite only dieting for five days.
      <br />
      <br />
      The final important takeaway from the study was that individuals who had
      worse health at the beginning of the FMD (such as higher blood pressure or a
      higher BMI than what is generally considered healthy) showed better
      improvement during the FMD compared to those who were more healthy before
      they began the FMD. For example, on average, participants who started with a
      BMI lower than 25 (which is considered healthy) lost, on average, 0.6 points
      on the BMI scale compared to those on a normal diet. However, those with a
      BMI between 25 and 30 lost 0.8 points on the BMI scale, and, finally,
      participants who started with a BMI over 30 lost 1.9 points on the BMI
      scale. Similarly, those with higher blood pressure and IGF-1 levels saw a
      greater reduction in blood pressure and IGF-1 compared to those who started
      the FMD at more healthy levels. Therefore, this study has very promising
      results for those who might just be starting to really look after their
      health.
      <br />
      <br />
      Thus, the data behind the FMD is very promising. While many people are
      getting more and more into fasting, learning how to fast in a healthy manner
      is very important, and the FMD appears to be a potentially great place to
      start. It should be noted, as with many scientific studies, that these
      results are far from conclusive. The study points out that more data should
      be gathered on people with underlying health issues to further understand
      the effects of the FMD going forward. On a similar note, the food the
      participants ate during the five days of fasting was highly controlled and
      contained specific amounts of vitamins, minerals and fats. Therefore, it is
      not a good idea to attempt the FMD or an FMD-like diet until more specifics
      on the types of food that should be consumed during the five day fast are
      released. However, for the time being, the FMD is an exciting diet that
      poses as a potential aid for those seeking a healthier life.
